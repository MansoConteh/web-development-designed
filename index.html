      <h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE</h1>
      <P>In this case, I’m using a selector that’s based on an attribute value. It matches an input 
            field in which the name attribute is set to email, and it binds to the focus event. This 
            event fires when the user places the cursor in that field. The event handler for the focus 
            event does two things: sets the value of the field to an empty string, and changes the 
            color from gray to black, but only if the value is person@example.com. If it’s something 
            else, it’s a value the user entered and should be left alone. Figure 18.9 shows what the 
            form looks like when the user initially clicks in the field.
            The other event handler is bound to the blur event, which fires when the cursor leaves 
            the field. If the field has no value, it changes the color back to gray and puts the example 
            input back into the field</P>
